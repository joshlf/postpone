================

This example creates ReadSeekers for four files, only three of which exist. Each of the different methods of ReadSeeker creation is demonstrated, as is the handling of bad readers.

###Use

To use, remove the "_test.go" extension before building (the suffix prevents the "go get" command from installing this example directory).
